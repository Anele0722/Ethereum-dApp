# Ethereum-dApp

We are building a website that I'll be calling the WavePortal but you can call it anything --- it'll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. (A smart contract is basically code that lives on the blockchain you can read and write. 

We'll be writing and deploying the smart contract and we'll also be building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with your smart contract.
