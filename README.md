# Ethereum-dApp

We are building a website that I'll be calling the WavePortal but you can call it anything --- it'll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who I am and send me a 👋 + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. (A smart contract is basically code that lives on the blockchain you can read and write. 

We'll be writing and deploying the smart contract and we'll also be building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with my
smart contract.

## What is a dApp

A Decentralized Application (DApp) is an application built on a decentralized network that consists of a smart contract backend and a user interface frontend. 

## Create Our Contract
 
 The first step is to create our contract and we do this by:
 
 1. ### Getting our local Ethereum  running 
  By getting our local Ethereum network running we will be able to compile and test our smart contract code.
