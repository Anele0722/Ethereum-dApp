# Ethereum-dApp

We are building a website that I'll be calling the WavePortal but you can call it anything --- it'll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who I am and send me a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. (A smart contract is basically code that lives on the blockchain you can read and write. 

We'll be writing and deploying the smart contract and we'll also be building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with my
smart contract. Although I won't be sharing all the steps in detail. 

## What is a dApp

A Decentralized Application (DApp) is an application built on a decentralized network that consists of a smart contract backend and a user interface frontend. 

## Create Our Contract
 
The first step is to create our contract and we do this by:
 
 1. ### Getting our local Ethereum network running 
 
 By getting our local Ethereum network running we will be able to compile and test our smart contract code. Below is an image that shows the final run test making sure   everything is working. 
 
 + Install Node.js
 + Install Hardhat

  2. ### Writing Smart Contract in Solidity

3. ### Compile Our Contract Locally and Run It
4. ### Store Data On Smart Contract 
5. ### Deploy Locally To Build Our Website 

Now that we have completed our first step, next we have to conncet to our wallet so that we start building our website 

## Connect To Wallet 

1. ### Set Up a Basic React App and Meta Mask
